            <li>
                Players can only move their pieces diagonally forward (towards their opponent)
            </li>
            <li>
                Regular pieces can only move one square at a time diagonally

            <li>
                When a regular piece reaches the opponent's back row, it is "kinged" and gets a crown

                <li>Kings can move both forward and backward diagonally</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Capture is mandatory when an opponent's piece is diagonally adjacent and there is an empty square immediately beyond it
            </li>
            <li>
                The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces or blocks them from making a legal move

                    Stop your opponents from being able to move any of their pieces
